# Rattlesnake Example 01
# Console output

# Simply enclose literal text by 'single quotes' to print it:
'Hello World'


# To print the evaluated result of an expression instead, surround it with `backticks`.
`2+2`


# Literal and evaluated output may be combined by writing them after each other:
'Two and two is '`2+2`', right?'

# But you can also simply enclose an evaluated snippet in a literal one to make it easier to type and read:
'Two and two is `2+2`, right?'
